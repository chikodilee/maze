## ✨ What Maze Does

- 🔔 **Instant Parking Alerts:**  
  As soon as you put your car in park, Maze checks your location against Toronto’s parking ticket database.  
  • ✅ If the spot is safe: you’ll see “No Parking Violations.”  
  • ⚠️ If it’s risky: you’ll get a system-wide notification.

- 📜 **Learn More About Violations**  
  Tap “Learn More” to see the type of violation, address, last ticket date, and estimated fine.

- 🅿️ **Find Parking Nearby**  
  Tap “Find Parking” to discover the closest safe parking spots.

- 📝 **Report Violations**  
  Help other drivers by reporting new violations. Maze auto-fills your recent parked addresses so you just enter the fine and type, then submit.
